## Typing stubs for toml

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `toml` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`toml`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/toml. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `c4c4bee8aa368b8c05d06559904531596e8a7be6`.
